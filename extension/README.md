running the extension:

1. `cd extension`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

you will now have a parcel server running that's watching your files and will hot reload the extension on save, bundling it into the `dist` directory. 

4. Navigate to `chrome://extension` and turn on dev mode if it's not already (top right corner)
5. Load unpacked
6. Find your dist folder
7. enable the server.
8. See it working by inspecting the popup.html and viewing the console logs.
